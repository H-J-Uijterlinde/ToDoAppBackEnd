# ToDoAppBackEnd

Created a RESTfull web api using Spring Boot, Data and Web.

This repository contains the code for the Back-End of a ToDo web application. The front-end of the applications was created using Angular,
and can be found in the ToDoAppFrontEnd repository.

The main requirements for the REST api were that is should be able to store, retrieve and update items in a postgreSQL database
Also it should be able to handle http requests from the front-end.
